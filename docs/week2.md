## Background Reading and Miniquestions

At the end of this week you should have a complete data set for the measured critical angle for (at least) five different masses.
Before you begin taking data, there are two principles that we would like to introduce: **“real-time data visualization”** and **“iterative experimental design”**. In taking experimental data, we don't want to just blindly follow the procedure laid out in the experimental design. We need to ensure the data we are taking is reasonable and that our conclusions are well-founded and impactful. One way to ensure the data is reasonable is to have some real-time visualization set up (“plotting as you go”). That way we can see our data as we are taking it, and adapt based on any new information.

*Warning* When “plotting as we go” we don’t want to make a real-time decision that incorrectly shapes our conclusions. For example, suppose we had made a plan to take 10 data points based on our exploratory measurements. But in taking the first 3 data points we notice a small sample standard deviation and that if we just stop taking data now, we end up with a reasonable conclusion. If we stop our hypothesis testing based on whether or not the data gives us the answer we are looking for, then we might draw **incorrect** conclusions based on the spread of just a few data points [explained here](https://replicationindex.com/2015/01/24/questionable-research-practices-definition-detect-and-recommendations-for-better-practices/){:target="_blank"}. If this puzzles you, you might look back to the discussion of [random uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty){:target="_blank"}. Related concerns are also raised [here](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/882:_Significant){:target="_blank"}.

To provide some separation between our experimental decisions and our hypothesis testing, we will iterate on our experimental design. It's okay to change your plan if it turned out to be a bad one. But we want to provide some justification for any changes we make to the initial plan. Here we will provide more details about the two principles we will employ this week, **“real-time data visualization”** and **“iterative experimental design”**. We encourage you to refer back to them as you undertake your detailed data collection.

### Real-time Data Visualization

An important habit we would like you to develop as an experimentalist is to be plotting/visualizing your data as you take it. Even though you made a plan with your experimental design, there are many unexpected things that can happen. You should set up your data collection (in Google Sheets) so that recording each data point automatically updates a plot of your data and calculates statistical quantities (sample mean, sample standard deviation, and standard error of the mean). Here are some things to keep an eye out for as your taking your data:

+ Is your sample mean very different than what you measured in your exploratory analysis?
    + If so, then try to troubleshoot what the differences might be (e.g. a calculation error, an uncontrolled variable), and then revise your approach if necessary

+ Does your data look **normally distributed** (like a Gaussian, bell-curve)?
    + If not, then you should try to investigate uncontrolled variables or perhaps increase the number data points of your experimental design

    **Note: if you have taken only a few data points, you shouldn’t expect your data to look like it’s normally distributed, even if it was being sampled from a normal distribution. Make sure you take enough data before checking if it's normally distributed.**

### Making an Experimental Plan

---------------------------------

#### Miniquestion: Making an experimental plan

+ How many data points would you need to take in order for any effect due to changing mass to be larger than your random uncertainty?


#### Miniquestion: How Many Trials

Before delving deeply into data collection it is helpul to take a step back and consider whether your experimental plan is practical. In this case, will you be able to complete the data collection in the time that should be allocated to a 1-unit class or is your plan unrealistic. Remember our goal is to make the strongest conclusion we can, which involves minimizing the experimental uncertainty. But more trials will take more time to perform, and there are diminishing returns to taking more data points. There is no right answer for balancing these two, but if your calculations suggest you need 10,000 data points to achieve your desired resolution your time might be better spent redesigning the experiment. While there is no magic number, for the purpose of this course, balancing realistical expectations on your time, we will generally be satisfied with 5 data points. Anything less than this becomes very suspect in terms of statistical analysis, but we do want to respect realistic limits on your time and encourage you to be mindful of this as well. This means that for this experiment we expect you to look at 5 different masses and to begin by collecting 5 data points for each mass. This “rule of thumb” will set our expectations throughout the course.


### Iterative Experimental Design

If your real-time data visualization indicates something is going wrong, you should iterate on your experimental design. Sometimes this is just as simple as making a note in your lab notebook of the revised plan. For example, *“The first 5 data points had a sample standard deviation larger than what was observed in the exploratory measurement. Instead of 5 data points, I will now take 10.”*

Or maybe you’ve noticed some uncontrolled factor in your experiment and you need to start over. In that case, carefully note any data that was taken, but do not delete it! Even if you aren’t going to include data you've taken in your analysis, it’s important to keep a record of what happened. Here’s an example of how you might document such an event in your lab notebook: *“My experimental design called for 5 data points, but in my first 3 data points I noticed a larger standard deviation than I expected based on my exploratory measurements. I noticed that the mass(es) inside my container sometimes shifted before the container began to slip on the ramp. The first 3 trials were taken without carefully controlling that factor, and I will not include them in my analysis. In subsequent trials, I will make sure the mass in my container is pushed up against the ‘downhill’ side of the container before starting. I will take 5 new data points according to my experimental design.”*

Often even if things go as planned and we finish taking data according to our experimental design, we can end up with an inconclusive or unclear result. Just because you complete your experimental design, doesn't mean you are done with your experiment! It's far easier to communicate your results when there is a clear conclusion. It's often worth the effort to revise your plan and take more data, which will save you time trying to communicate your results (which we will do in Week 3) and allow you to reach a stronger conclusion. (Quality of data will be one of the considerations in grading your final deliverable.)

As an experimentalist, you have to make the tough decision of when the experiment is complete. It takes years of experience to build up the knowledge and intuition to comfortably decide “when am I done?”. Even collaborators in the same research group can disagree on this point. To help get you started, let's look at a few examples in the following miniquestion.

## Reminder on Reporting Data with Significant Figures

In week 1 (Module 0), we introduced you to the idea of significant figures. As a reminder: we only want to report digits that are significant — accurately reflect the precision of our experiment — in our results. Here are the rules we ask you to use in this class:

1. Round and keep only one digit in your uncertainty

    + For example we might report an uncertainty of $$\delta \mu_s = 0.006$$

    **Exception**: if the first non-zero digit — is a 1 or 2, then report two digits in the uncertainty. For example: if your uncertainty is 0.0237304 then its first non-zero digit is a 2 so we will keep two digits, resulting in an uncertainty of 0.024 after rounding.

2. Round your measured value so the placement of the least significant digit matches that of the rounded uncertainty. Wow, that sounds confusing so let’s see how this applies to our example above:

    + Suppose we began with 0.44030407 ± 0.01203726. We determined that the uncertainty should be 0.012, meaning the least significant digit of the uncertainty is in the 3rd decimal place. We need to round our measurement value to the same digit so the value we will report for our measurement is **0.440 ± 0.012**.

## Review of Uncertainty Estimation

Before collecting and analyzing your data this week, please make sure that you have read this [discussion about combining uncertainties](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1/uncertainty-introduction#combining-uncertainties)

And if you're confused about the rounding of the values, you might want to [read this first](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1/uncertainty-introduction#significant-figures)

To make sure you've understood these ideas, please complete the following mini-question. This is going to come up repeatedly throughout the course. If you have any uncertainty about your response please stop by office hours and talk to us or consult with your classmates through Piazza.

## Week 2 - Generating Data to Test a Hypothesis



## Data Collection

With the background reading complete, you are now ready to start the data collection process.

### Step 1: Set-up a Spreadsheet

You will use the same Google sheets document as last week, but you will want to open a new tab/“sheet” (bottom left) and organize it for this week’s data collection.

Your spreadsheet should allow you to:
+ Record data.
+ Plot your data in real time.
+ Analyze your data. In this case your goal is to determine the co-efficient of static friction for each mass.

![spreadsheet example](images/plot-as-you-go.gif)


Look back to the spreadsheet you used for your preliminary data collection last week. You will want to organize your data collection in a similar way.


<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Click here for detailed steps to guide you through the process of setting up your spreadsheet
</summary>

These steps will guide you through this process:


1. Begin by creating a new sheet in your worksheet for this module using the add sheet button in the bottom left.
2. Set up a table to determine the critical angle for the first mass.

    + Give the table a title.

    + Title the column you will be using for data collection ($$\theta_c$$)

    + Use the borders feature to outline the table.

        <img src="images/borders.JPG" alt="The border button will allow you to outline your table" width="125"/>


3. Set up a graph to plot your data in real time. For this experiment you will want to plot a histogram of your measurements of the the critical angle $$\theta_c$$. Today we are setting up an informal plot to look at our data in real time. This is different from a more formal figure that you would use to share/communicate your results --- creating formal figures is a more careful process, we will do that next week after we've collected and reflected on our data. Here we summarize how to create a histogram in sheets. You can find more helpful information at: [*Click here to open in a new tab*](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9146867?hl=en){:target="_blank"}

    + You can add a chart by selecting "insert" and then "chart" from the drop down menus.

    + A new “Chart Editor” menu will appear on the RHS of the screen. Use the drop down menu under chart type to select “histogram”.

        <img src="images/Histogram.JPG" alt="The border button will allow you to outline your table" width="125"/>

    + On the next line of the “Chart Editor” set data range to be the cells in which you plan to insert your data (you may have to go back and edit this later if you collect more data than expected).

    + Press the x in the top right to exit the chart editor.

    + Click on your chart and move it to a convenient spot in your worksheet. You will want to customize the chart further once you begin collecting data.

5. Now add a row to calculate the average value for the critical angle, $$\theta_c$$, and standard error. This will be analogous to what you did last week just with more data, go ahead and look back to last week’s worksheet to set-up the calculations.

6. Add another row to use the same calculations you did last week to calculate the coefficient of static friction, $$\mu_s$$, for your new data set.

7. Now you need to set up your worksheet to collect data for the second mass. There are two ways you might go about this. One is to add a second column to the right of your first column, duplicating the equations for your calculations. You should then create a second histogram to monitor the data from the second mass in real time. Alternatively, you can duplicate the sheet. At the bottom left are tabs that allow you to have multiple sheets in your worksheet. If you click on the downward arrow next to your sheet name a menu will appear. Click on “duplicate” and you will now have a second identical sheet ready for data from your second mass. You can rename your sheets from the same menu.
 <img src="images/Duplicating_sheet_in_sheets.png" alt="The duplicate menu item will allow you to duplicate your worksheet, easily creating a second worksheet already set-up for the second mass" width="125"/>

Once you have collected a few data points you will want to go back to the chart editor and select customize. Next week we will focus on polishing our plot for communicating our results but even for your own records you want to make a few adjustments while collecting data.

+ Use the Chart and axis title dropdown to add a chart title

+ Within the same dropdown menu, if you click on chart title you can change the dropdown to “Horizontal axis title”. Go ahead and label your axis.

+ The histogram dropdown will allow you to change the bucket size (by default it will be on auto which you may or may not find satisfactory depending on your data)

----------------------------------


### Step 2: Collect and analyze data

Make sure to record all relevant details such as what mass you are using. Always include units when recording data. When switching back and forth between the masses to randomize your experiment, then be very careful about where in your spreadsheet you are recording your data.  

As you collect data, be on the lookout for problems like those mentioned in the [Real-time Data Visualization](#real-time-data-visualization) section above. The histogram and summary statistics of your critical angle will help you identify if you need to adjust your plan.

Depending on how you record your data you may find it helpful to know that within the Phyphox app, if you select "Plane" and then Pick data you can pick off the value of data points without exporting the data. This will not be necessary if you are collecting data in real time but is helpful if, for example, you are quickly lowering the ramp when the container begins to slip and then going back to find the maximum angle.

### Step 3: Reflect and Iterate

It is important to take a moment to reflect on your results. Are there any anomalies in your data? (This is often a reason to collect more data.) Are your final results and uncertainties reasonable? How do your results compare with your hypothesis?

At this point, you need to consider if your results are conclusive. Review the section [Iterative Experimental Design](#iterative-experimental-design) above. If your results are inconclusive, then can you think of some reasonable* steps that you can take to improve your measurement? If so, then come up with a revised experimental plan and try it!

**“Reasonable” is subjective. We don't expect for the purposes of our Module 1 that you will take hundreds of data points. But if taking 5 more data points will result in a stronger conclusion, then we encourage you to do so! It is also important to recognize that statistical analysis is not valid for very small numbers of data points. As a rough guide we would not consider a statistical analysis relying on less than 5 data points to be valid and therefore recommend you collect no fewer than 5 data points for each mass.*

When analyzing data keep in mind that the data point's error bars do not need to all overlap for the data to be in agreement. A rule of thumb is that **a data point that agrees with some value can fall anywhere within roughly one error bar of that value.** We will learn more about this in the coming weeks.

Next week you will make use of the Matlab software package to plot your data. If you do not have Matlab installed on your device we encourage you to install it to be prepared for next week's assignment (HMC has a site license). If you have any issues please reach out to us. The CIS help desk can also be helpful with installation issues.

## Before you leave lab today

Make sure you have the following:

+ a good picture of your experimental set-up. You will need this for your final deliverable. A good image should minimize unnecessary clutter, include everything of relevance to understanding your experimental set-up, and will need to include a scale bar. Therefore, it is important that you plan for this when taking your photo (i.e. there needs to be an item in your photo whose dimensions you know and can use to add the scale bar later). The image should also be in focus and be taken from an angle that showcases your experimental set-up. This picture will be included in your final deliverable so take the time to take a good picture.

+ A set of data for each of 5 different masses. Quality of data will be taken into consideration in grading your final deliverable.

## Checkpoint #2

Please submit the following to Module 1, Checkpoint #2 on Gradescope. 

**As a reminder: Please prepare your assignment in a separate document, enter all entries in a single sitting without using the "save" button and then make use of the "submit" button to submit your work. You may not resubmit your work once it has been submitted (and saving in Gradescope is equivalent to submitting).**

+ A screen-shot showing an organized spreadsheet used for data collection

+ A picture of your experimental set-up. You do not need to include a scale bar this week, but you should have a plan for adding one next week (i.e. there needs to be an item in your picture whose dimensions you know).

+ A histogram for each mass tested showing the distribution of the number of data points collected as a function of the angle $$\theta_c$$. You should have collected data for five different masses, with 5 data points for each mass.

+ The value you obtained for the coefficient of static friction, $$\mu_s$$, for 3 of the 5 masses (smallest, middle, and largest), including the estimated uncertainty. Please make sure to use significant figures appropriately. If unsure please reread the section on significant figures, come to office hours to discuss, and/or consult your classmates through Piazza.

+ A single-sentence, preliminary conclusion that you can draw about the hypothesis based on your experimental data

## Grading Rubric
